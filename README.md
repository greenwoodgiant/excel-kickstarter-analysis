## Kickstarter Analysis with Excel

# Insights Gained from Analysis

Kickstarter is a good place for new entertainment ventures, as the bulk of successful projects fall in the Theater, Film/TV, and Music categories. 

Documentaries and Rock-related projects are likelier than others to succeed, having not only large amounts of projects, but 100% successful results.

Spring/Early Summer is the better time to start an Entertainment project, as the number of successful projects rise while the number of cancelled or failed projects remains relatively stable.

# Limitations of this Dataset

The overwhelming majority of projects are from United States, so any insights gained are not as helpful outside the US. We would want to either focus the question down to just within the US and remove other countries, or grow the data set so other countries have more representation.

Many sub-categories have under 100 projects to compare. For sub-categories to be an effective measuring tool, we would want to either combine certain sub-categories, limiting the number of unique categories, or grow the data set.

The data weâ€™re choosing to look at may not be the most important things about a project. I would definitely want to look at rewards structure, for example, such as number of tiers, price for each tier, and number of redeemers at each tier could give us an idea of what rewards attract the most backers.
